# (VMOxRMIT) - Capstone Project - OpenCV

## Introduction 
_For this project, we have worked on the human detection and counting for retail stores. Our project is capable of detecting and count number of individuals in the frame, then generate a heatmap for hot spots inside the store. Once a human is detected in the video, we have tracked that person and provide label for them as number. After scanning through number of human detected in various positions of the camera, we generate a heatmap to identify the customers' flow and hot spots for the store. Our project is mostly based on the application of machine learning and image processing conducted by [openCV](http://opencv.org)._ **This code is built on opencv 4.9.0.8, python 3.11, other versions of opencv are NOT SUPPORTED.**
